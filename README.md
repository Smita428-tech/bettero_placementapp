Training and Placement Cell is an important part of any educational institute. So, to make the placement process easy and effective for the training and placement department as well as the students, an Android application should be developed for students. 
          This app can help the students in getting the details of upcoming job offers of companies and their events. The students can register the android application and view the events of particular company. The android application also provides facility of maintaining details of students along with the placement records of the college. This project will also be helpful in the efficient management of the placement related activities in the college with the help of alumni & alumnae.
